Second Matrix releves_env_data.csv 


STEP 1 - NMDS

5 spp, two removed as only found at one location (Sphagnum and Aulacomnium)
using Domin 2.6 values as needed for indicator spp
54 relevés included

autopilot/slow&thorough = 250 runs real data + 250 runs randomized data
Bray-Curtis (Sørensen) distance
title "Carran-D26: Carran bryophytes Aug 2020 NMS, one-occurence spp. removed, Domin2.6"

3D solution.
      10.98743 = final stress for 3-dimensional solution
       0.00190 = final instability

Outliers: using Summary > Outlier analysis
two relevés C30 and C18 more than 2 std dev from mean distance
C30 = 2.05366 C18 = 2.04378
Saved as outliers.txt
Where are these located? Anything interesting about the spp present, water, etc?

3D graphs saved as BMP, for water and VegCom scatterplots

2D graphs as follows:

Dominance curve - saved as plots\dominance-1.wmf and data in dominance-results.txt
Is the data able to give this plot (Domin or Domin2.6)? Maybe need better abundance info for it?

Overlay of main ordination with each species Domin value for each pair of axes, e.g. Cc-1-3.wmf in 
plots\overlays-by-sp-on-main-ordination (15 plots, for 5 species with 3 axis pairs each)

Overlays of spp in ord space in plots\overlays-by-sp-on-main-ordination

Overlays of 4 environmental variables in plots\env-variables-overlays



STEP 2 - CLUSTER ANALYSIS

Results saved in cluster-analysis.txt. Setup as per Waldren notes.

Dendrogram plots saved in plots\dendrograms for all 12 groups, WMF and .den data file.

2 way dendrograms for all groups in plots\2way_dendrograms, WMF and .twd data files

Ordination v groups in plots\clusters\g?? - graphs as WMF with axis coordinates



STEP 3 - INDICATOR SPECIES ANALYSIS

random seed = 2305
