Carran turlough is a large turlough (90.3 ha) with two
basins in the East Burren Special Area of Conservation. This project
studied the Fahee basin to the north-east. Carran is unusual in
having a layer of peat over much of its area, despite being located
in a karst landscape. The objectives of the project were to determine
the bryophyte species in Carran turlough and identify possible
bryophyte communities. Some aspects of the project were constrained
by high water levels during the survey, and by limited access because
of farming activity.<br/>
<br/>
Bryophytes are a large and diverse
group of plants of ecological and evolutionary importance, divided
into mosses (Bryophyta), liverworts (Marchantiophyta) and hornworts
(Anthocerotophyta). Their features distinguish them from vascular
plants. <br/>
<br/>
Relevés of 0.5m×0.5m were chosen at 54 points.
The bryophyte species present were recorded for each relevé using
the Domin scale and samples were collected. The positions of relevés
and water sampling points were recorded using GPS and mapped using
satellite photographs. Previous surveys of the turlough were used to
identify vegetation types.<br/>
<br/>
Seven moss species were found.
Two (<i>Sphagnum subnitens</i> and <i>Aulacomnium palustre</i>)
occurred in only one relevé each and were excluded from later
analysis. The other species found were <i>Calliergonella cuspidata</i>,
<i>Ctenidium molluscum</i>, <i>Cinclidotus fontinaloides</i>,
<i>Rhizomnium punctatum</i> and <i>Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus</i>. It
was found that <i>C. cuspidata</i> was very widespread in the
turlough and dominant in most relevés. <i>C. molluscum</i> was also
widespread but less abundant. <i>C. fontinaloides</i> was found at
the edges of the area subject to inundation. <i>R. punctatum</i> was
widespread but abundant only in very wet areas. <i>R. triquetrus</i>
was found in drier areas. One liverwort species, <i>Riccia sorocarpa</i>,
was recorded at a single location. A number of other species
associated with turloughs were not recorded, but this may be due to
limitations of the survey rather than absence.<br/>
<br/>
The data on
species were analysed using Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling with
PC-ORD software. Cluster analysis and indicator species analysis
identifiedfour assemblages. The <i>Calliergonella cuspidata</i>
assemblage was found throughout the survey area and was dominated by
<i>C. cuspidata</i> with some <i>R. punctatum</i>. The <i>Ctenidium
molluscum-Calliergonalla cuspidata</i> assemblage was found in more
calcicole areas. The <i>Cinclidotus fontinaloides</i> assemblage was
found in drier areas near the edges of the turlough. The <i>Rhizomnium
punctatum-Calliergonella cuspidata</i> assemblage occurred in the
wetter areas. Consideration of habitat indicators suggested that
moisture is the most important factor defining the assemblages
observed, with light and perhaps some slight local phosphorous
enrichment also being influences. No clear association was found
between vascular plant communities and bryophyte communities.<br/>
<br/>
Water
samples from 15 points were analysed for pH, alkalinity, total
phosphorous and soluble reactive phosphorous. The pH of a flush
entering the north side of the basin was also assessed. Analysis
found that pH and alkalinity in Carran turlough were similar to those
in other oligotrophic turloughs, and that water quality was within
national limits. The flush was slightly more acidic than water in the
turlough itself, probably because it passes through peat soil.<br/>
<br/>
The
previously-reported presence of <i>Drosera rotundifolia</i> was
confirmed. The presence of this, and of <i>S. subnitens</i>, is
anomalous since both species are usually found in acidic
habitats.<br/>
<br/>
The project results give an initial assessment
of the bryophyte diversity and communities present, and suggest no
major changes to the environmental status of the turlough since 2014.
Some possible directions for future research are suggested based on
the project results.<br/>
