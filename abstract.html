    <br>
    Carran turlough is a large (90.3 ha in area) turlough located in the
    East Burren Special Area of Conservation. It consists of two basins.
    Carran is unusual in having a layer of peat over much of its area,
    despite being located in a karst landscape. This project studied the
    Fahee basin to the north-east.<br>
    <br>
    Bryophytes are a large and diverse group of plants of ecological and
    evolutionary importance, divided into mosses (Bryophyta), liverworts
    (Marchantiophyta) and hornworts (Anthocerotophyta). Their features
    distinguish them from vascular plants. <br>
    <br>
    The objectives of the project were to determine the bryophyte
    species present in Carran turlough and identify possible communities
    and environmental influences forming them.<br>
    <br>
    Relevés of 0.5m×0.5m were chosen at 54 points. The bryophyte species
    present were recorded for each relevé using the Domin scale and
    samples were collected. The positions of relevés and water sampling
    points were recorded using GPS and mapped using satellite
    photographs. Previous surveys of the turlough were used to identify
    vegetation types.<br>
    <br>
    In total, seven moss species were found. Of these, two (<i>Sphagnum
      subnitens</i> and <i>Aulacomnium palustre</i>) occurred in only
    one relevé each and were excluded from later analysis. The other
    species found were <i>Calliergonella cuspidata</i>, <i>Ctenidium
      molluscum</i>, <i>Cinclidotus fontinaloides</i>, <i>Rhizomnium
      punctatum</i> and <i>Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus</i>. It was found
    that <i>C. cuspidata</i> was very widespread in the turlough and
    dominant in most relevés. <i>C. molluscum</i> was also widespread
    but less abundant. <i>C. fontinaloides</i> was found at the edges
    of the area subject to inundation. <i>R. punctatum</i> was
    widespread but abundant only in very wet areas. <i>R. triquetrus</i>
    was found in drier areas. One liverwort species, <i>Riccia
      sorocarpa</i>, was recorded at a single location. A number of
    other species associated with turloughs were not recorded, but this
    may be due to limitations of the survey rather than absence.<br>
    <br>
    The data on species were analysed using Non-Metric Multidimensional
    Scaling with PC-ORD version 5 software. Cluster analysis and
    indicator species analysis were used to identify four assemblages.
    The <i>Calliergonella cuspidata</i> assemblage was found throughout
    the survey area and was dominated by <i>C. cuspidata</i> with some
    <i>R. punctatum</i>. The <i>Ctenidium molluscum-Calliergonalla </i><i>cuspidata</i>
    assemblage was found in more calcicole areas and also included <i>R.
      punctatum</i>. The <i>Cinclidotus fontinaloides</i> assemblage
    was found in drier areas near the edges of the turlough. The <i>Rhizomnium
      punctatum-Calliergonella cuspidata</i> assemblage occurred in the
    wetter areas. Consideration of habitat indicators suggested that
    moisture is the most important factor defining the assemblages
    observed, with light and perhaps some slight local phosphorous
    enrichment also being influences.<br>
    <br>
    Water samples were collected at 15 points in the turlough and
    analysed for pH, alkalinity, total phosphorous and soluble reactive
    phosphorous. The pH of a flush entering the north side of the basin
    was also assessed. Analysis of the samples shows that conditions of
    pH and alkalinity in Carran turlough were similar to those in other
    turloughs, and that water quality was within national limits for
    phosphorous. The flush was found to be more acidic than water in the
    turlough itself, probably because it passes through peat soil.<br>
    <br>
    The previously-reported presence of <i>Drosera rotundifolia</i> was
    confirmed. The presence of this, and of <i>S. subnitens</i>, is
    probably due to the history of Carran turlough as a bog since both
    species are usually found in that habitat.<br>
    <br>
    Some aspects of the project were constrained by high water levels
    during the survey period, and by limited access to some areas of the
    turlough because of farming activity.<br>
    <br>
    The results of the project provide an initial assessment of the
    bryophyte diversity and communities present, as well as a snapshot
    of some environmental characteristics. They also support the view
    that no major changes to the environmental status of the turlough
    have happened since the last survey in 2014.<br>
